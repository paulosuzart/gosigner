Sample app to run o GAE golang runtime.

Just playing with knockout.js.
The app runs without any Go template. That is, htmls are served directly by GAE runtime and knockout.js is responsible to make things work with the server.

The las commit uses knockout.js. To see the version usin backbone.js refer to old commits.
